# What is UnicontaPowerToys ?
UnicontaPowerToys is a collection code to help to streamline working with Uniconta's API.

The code will usally be based (.Net Core) or .Net what ever you wanna call it on Uniconta's latest API current is [Uniconta.NetStandardAPI2.1 v94.0.0.6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Uniconta.NetStandardAPI2.1/)

# Why opensource ?
A few reasons...

1: Currently i work for a Company using Uniconta heavly and like any software Uniconta is not perfect. So the goal is to point out some issues and give potential solutions.
2: Im hoping this will help new devs understand how Uniconta's API work abit more. I properly wont give super detailed explanations but the code will be available.

# What to expect ?
Dont expect this to be a nuget package this is just a repo for the code to be public.
Dont expect me to update on the regular.

# What is UnicontaPowerToys ?
UnicontaPowerToys is a collection code to help to streamline working with Uniconta's API.

The code will usally be based (.Net Core) or .Net what ever you wanna call it on Uniconta's latest API current is [Uniconta.NetStandardAPI2.1 v94.0.0.6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Uniconta.NetStandardAPI2.1/)

# Why opensource ?
A few reasons...

- I feel like it.
- Currently i work for a Company using Uniconta heavly and like any software Uniconta is not perfect. So the goal is to point out some issues and give potential solutions.
- Im hoping this will help new devs understand how Uniconta's API work abit more. I properly wont give super detailed explanations but the code will be available.

# What to expect ?
- Im not perfect, nore the best developer but i try my best :)
- Dont expect this to be a nuget package this is just a repo for the code to be public.
- Dont expect me to update on the regular.
- I mostly develop API's and not inside the Uniconta Client (Plugin/Pages ect.) Code should work in both places especially after Uniconta switches the client to run .Net and not .Net Framwork
